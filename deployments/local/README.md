# Run application locally in a docker collection

The scripts and configuration files contained in this directory create 3 containers:

- A MySQL database container
- A Redis datastore container
- A container for everything else

The contents of the latter container are taken from the local filesystem.

You'll find details on how to create and use these containers in the
root [README.md](../../README.md)
